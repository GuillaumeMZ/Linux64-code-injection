; since rsp mod 16 must be equal to 8 when a called function starts, it means it must be divisible by 16 before a call (since a call pushes a 8 byte address on the stack)
; our shellcode contains only a call, so it means rsp mod 16 must equal 0 when executing it (so that the aligment constraint will be satisfied, oterwise it will crash)
